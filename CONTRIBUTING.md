## Frequently asked questions

#### **Did you find a bug?** :bug:

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kfirgirstein/ACISDetector/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kfirgirstein/ACISDetector/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .py file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- [ ] A quick summary and/or background
- [ ] Steps to reproduce
  - [ ] Be specific!
  - [ ] Give sample code if you can.
- [ ] What actually happens
- [ ] Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of ACISDetector will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by [open a new issue](https://github.com/kfirgirstein/ACISDetector/issues/new) and start writing code.

* We recommend that you first collecte a few positive feedback about the change.
